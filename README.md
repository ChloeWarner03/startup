# Wack-a-Mole

[My Notes](notes.md)

The application that I want to create is a Wack-a-Mole. It was one of the games that I loved to play as a little girl when we went to the arcade. I am going to have it so then they have a sign-in page so then they can make an account and with that, they will be able to start the game. It will start pretty easy and slow and you will be able to get points for the moles that you are successfully able to kit in that timeframe. As the game continues the moles are going to get faster and faster and at the end of the game, you will be able to see your score. You will also be able to go to a different page and see the high scores of the other players that have played the game.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for the game and one for the highscores
- **CSS** - animating the game and style of the login and the highscores
- **REACT** - Provides login, interactive part of the game and the highscores
- **Web Service** - Uses Savescores to save the highscores of the player and apilayer mailboxlayer ([https://eva.pingutil.com/](https://mailboxlayer.com/)) to validate email addresses of the players when they are making a login
- **Authentication** - Allows player to create an account and login.
- **Database data**: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Wack-a-Mole, this is the high scores of all players.
- **WebSocket data** -  A rendering of data that is received from your server. For Wack-a-Mole, the newest high score will be sent to players
